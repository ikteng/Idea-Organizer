# Idea-Organizer

💡 “Idea Organizer” – Smart Thought Whiteboard App
🧠 Problem:
People often jot down thoughts in notes, docs, or voice memos—but rarely revisit, categorize, or expand them. Ideas remain shallow, disorganized, and forgotten.

✅ Key Features
1. Visual Idea Board
Like a minimalist whiteboard (think Miro meets Notion).

Users can add "idea cards" with text.

Cards can be freely arranged in a grid or clustered view.

3. Idea Clustering / Related Detection
Auto-detect similar or duplicate ideas.

Show links between related cards (“this seems related to…”).

Graph view mode for seeing idea clusters.


6. Search & Filter
Search by keyword, category, or tag.

Filter ideas by relatedness or development stage.
